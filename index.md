<span style="font-size: 16pt;"><b>Hi. I'm Seonuk Kim</b> ðŸ˜Š</span>

<p style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 160%;">
  I'm an undergraduate student at <a href="https://unist.ac.kr/">UNIST</a>, and double majoring in <a href="https://ie.unist.ac.kr/eng/">Industrial Engineering</a> and <a href="https://design.unist.ac.kr/">Design</a>. I was a machine learning scientist at <a href="https://thingsflow.com/">thingsflow</a>. <strong>I'm currently looking for a new position.</strong> <br><br>
  My research interest is <strong>Human-Centered AI</strong>, notably in the field of content creation. I am exploring how AI can assist individuals in effortlessly creating their own comics or animations and how it can contribute to their sense of achievement and satisfaction from their creations. In this process, the interaction between AI and users is of paramount importance. It is crucial that AI accurately understands the user's intentions, offers creative ideas, and aids users in deeply engaging and enjoying their creative process.<br><br>
  Outside of work, I enjoy comics, animations, novels, and coffee time with my friends â˜•
