<span style="font-size: 16pt;"><b>Hi. I'm Seonuk Kim</b> ðŸ˜Š</span>

<p style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 160%;">
  I'm currently a machine learning scientist at <a href="https://thingsflow.com/">Thingsflow</a> and research assistant at <a href="https://www.klee141.com/">Expressive Computing Lab</a> in UNIST led by Prof. Kyungho Lee. I'm also an undergraduate student at <a href="https://unist.ac.kr/">UNIST</a>, and double majoring in Industrial Engineering and Design.<br><br>
  My research interests are <strong>human-AI interaction</strong>, specially around content creation, how people easily create their own comics or animations with AI, and how AI can help people to get accomplishment and satisfaction from their own creation.<br><br>
  Outside of work, I enjoy comics, animations, novels, and coffee time with my friends â˜•
