Authored a research proposal that was selected for the UNIST Artificial Intelligence Graduate School (AIGS) Creative Independent Project Research, receiving a grant of 5 million KRW for the study. Proposed the research topic and designed a controlled experiment, creating a collar with a 9-axis IMU sensor, [MetaMotionS+](https://mbientlab.com/store/metamotions-p/), to measure cat movements. Obtained time-series data on the location, acceleration, and angular velocity of cat behaviors, and conducted preprocessing to contribute to the development of the model.
