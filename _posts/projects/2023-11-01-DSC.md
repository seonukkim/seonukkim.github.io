As the leader of Team OpsIEdian in the 3rd POSTECH-UNIST-KAIST Data Science Competition, achieved 3rd place, winning a gold prize. Working with real data from LG Electronics, forecasted product parts demand using decision tree-based ensemble models and addressed inventory management problems with Auto ARIMA and heuristic decision-making. In the final round, our presentation discussed the strengths and weaknesses of the techniques attempted, suggestions for improvements in terms of data, model, interface, and evaluation metrics, and submitted a 58-page report.
