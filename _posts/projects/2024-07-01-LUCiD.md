I utilized Stable Diffusion XL for images, Luma AI for videos, Suno AI for music, and MetaMind Creative AI along with some Freesound CC0 licensed audio for sound effects.'

"LUCiD" is an animation where everything, except for the editing, has been created using AI: images, videos, music, sound effects, and even voices. This project was born out of curiosity to see how high I could push the quality of animations using the recently released Dream Machine by Luma AI.

I utilized Stable Diffusion XL for images, Luma AI for videos, Suno AI for music, and MetaMind Creative AI along with some Freesound CC0 licensed audio for sound effects.
Given the nature of Luma AI, creating videos based on Pixar-style 3D animations and live-action images is more effective than traditional 2D animations.

Creating this video made me envision a future where AI truly acts as artificial "intelligence," collaborating or competing with humans in creating content from scenarios to storyboards and editing as a language model. This is likely a future envisioned by all companies dreaming of AI-driven content creation.
